# BaderCharge_plotter

Leverages ASE, numpy and pyplot to calculate the differences in Bader charges between two structures acquired from VASP and then colour the different atoms according to the difference in charge (i.e., whether positive or negative).

Version 2.0 (v2.0) current release.

# Version 2.0

Version 2.0 (v2.0) updates the Bader charge visualisation for reaction/NEB structures.

Key updates:

* Initial, final and Δq plots use consistent atom ordering.
* An optional external reference structure can be used to align the reference surface.
* Without an external reference, the final structure is used as the reference.
* Reference atoms are defined using `reference_symbols` (default: `("Ni",)`).
* Reference structures are checked for element and atom-count consistency.

## Reference structure

An optional external reference structure can be used to maintain a consistent representation of the reference surface between the initial and final states.

In `main.py`:

```python
reference_folder = "reference"
reference_symbols = ("Ni",)
```

If no external reference is required:

```python
reference_folder = None
```

The reference folder should contain either a `CONTCAR` or `POSCAR`, with `CONTCAR` preferred.

The selected `reference_symbols` identify the atoms used to align the reference representation.

When an external reference is supplied, the selected reference atoms in the initial and final structures are represented consistently with the external reference while the remaining atoms retain their respective reaction-state positions.

When no external reference is supplied, the selected reference atoms in the initial structure are aligned to their corresponding positions in the final structure.

# General procedure

## Overview

This analysis will calculate the Bader charge difference between the initial and final stages of a transition state (e.g., NEB). The charge difference is calculated for the complete structure and is displayed using the final-state atomic positions.

## Folder and file access

The atomic positions (POSCAR/CONTCAR) and the Bader charges (ACF.dat) will have been collected through VASP calculations. These will be placed within the initial and final folders of each reaction/transition, relative to the main.py file, which is the main file that executes the code. The names of the initial and final folders are respectively "ini" and "fin" by default and additional and/or replacement names (e.g., "initial", "final", "is", "fs") can be provided. If a .json file containing the maximum desired Bader charge already exists, then the user can choose to import the value or ignore it.

An optional external reference structure can also be supplied through `reference_folder` in `main.py`. This structure is used to maintain a consistent representation of the selected reference atoms between systems.

## Projection

Additionally, atoms will be shifted in a given direction in case they (particularly adsorbates) extend over the unit cell dimensions, especially in the x,y planes and will be relative to the atom in each system that possesses the highest radius. The user will need to input integers of the x, y shifts, which will be multiplied by the maximum covalent diameter in the system (i.e., input such integers as -1, 0, +1, etc., where negative = left/down shift and positive = right/up shift). That is, all of the atoms will be shifted left, right, up, or down depending on what input value and sign is input.

For reviewing images for shifting, one of the following methods must be selected and confirmed:

1: Same shift per (ini, fin) pair (That is, whatever shift is selected for the initial image will also be projected to the final image and each image set will be iterated through. The initial unprojected image will be displayed prior to assigning the shift and the final projected image will be displayed as well.)

2: Manual shift for EACH structure (That is, this expands from mode 1, though each individual image will be checked and projected rather than in pairs.)

3: Same shift for ALL images (That is, after the shift is applied to one image set, this will be globalised as a variable and then applied to all other images. In this mode, if shift.json already exists, then it can be input. Afterwards, it may be deleted.)

4: NO shift to ANY image (That is, apply no shift to any individual image)

If any of the inputs (see [Inputs](#inputs)) are not appropriately met with the program requirements, then the inputs will be looped and re-initiated for the user.

## Colour coding

After conducting the projections, the difference in Bader charge between both images will be calculated. From this, the initial and final atomic systems will be elementally colour-coded which can be configured (e.g., Ni = lightgray, C = black) and saved into an image and the final image will be reincluded adjacent and colour coded (default: red-blue) using a colormap depending on the Bader charge range. The Bader charge transition image now contains the **complete final atomic structure**, with each atom coloured according to its Bader charge difference. Please note that the maximum absolute Bader charge difference across all images will be stored and used in determining the colormap range. The initial and final images will be arranged vertically on the left-hand side of the image and the Bader charge transition image will be included singularly on the right-hand side of the image. Any Bader charge difference values below the given threshold (default: 0.005) will be zeroed and therefore not coloured. All images will be given as top view (default: ('0x,0y,0z')) and as single periodicity ((1,1,1)) by default and can be adjusted.

If a reference structure is supplied, the selected reference atoms are aligned to its periodic representation for the initial and final visualisations. If no reference structure is supplied, the selected reference atoms in the initial structure are aligned to the final structure.

## Image saving

The figures will be saved in a new folder called "Bader_plots". Furthermore, if the ini and fin folders are nested within additional folders, the os.walk() function will find them, the folder locations will be stored and these new folders will be created within "Bader_plots" to save the images, so as to make them easier to find. Prior to the images being output and saved, the folder/image name will be printed for reference.

Example saved images are provided below.

## Inputs

### Bader.json found

Existing bader_max.json found. Load saved maximum Bader charge difference?

Accept this result/outcome? (y/n):

### Mode selection

The inputs are as follows (N.B. if these are not followed, then these questions will be repeated until an appropriate response is provided):

Enter mode (1/2/3/4):

Confirm mode x? (y/n):

### Shifting

Previewing structure. (I.e., view the structure prior to shifting and then close it)

Press Enter to close the figure...

Manual shift using max_radius = x.xxx Å (Starts after closing the figure. This will provide that maximum covalent diameter, e.g., 2.480 Å for Ni)

Shift in x (multiples of diameter, N.B. negative = left/down, positive = right/up): (I.e., input the +/- integer for the shift in the x-direction, this number will be multiplied by the covalent diameter, and all atoms in the unit cell will be shifted by that distance and in that direction)

Shift in y (multiples of diameter, N.B. negative = left/down, positive = right/up): (Same as with the previous, but in the y-direction)

Press Enter to close the figure...

Accept this result? (y/n): y (Starts after closing the figure)

### Delete shift.json

Existing shift.json detected. Delete shift.json?

Accept this result/outcome? (y/n):

### Reference structure

The reference structure is optional.

```python
reference_folder = "reference"
reference_symbols = ("Ni",)
```

To disable the external reference:

```python
reference_folder = None
```

The reference structure must contain a `CONTCAR` or `POSCAR`. The program checks that the requested reference elements and their atom counts are consistent with each reaction/NEB structure.

# Key files, folders and inputs

## Folder structure

reactionORtransition/

-> ini/

->-> CONTCARorPOSCAR

->-> ACF.dat

-> fin/

->-> CONTCARorPOSCAR

->-> ACF.dat

I.e., CONTCAR/POSCAR and ACF.dat are mandatory for the code to work

An optional reference structure can additionally be provided:

reference/

-> CONTCARorPOSCAR

E.g., ![Hydrogenation](Hydrogenation/), as provided, contains ![C6](Hydrogenation/C6) and ![CH2O](Hydrogenation/CH2O) folders that each contain "fin" and "ini" and likewise contain CONTCAR/POSCAR and ACF.dat. When saving images into ![Bader\_plots](Bader_plots), as the two key folders are contained within "C6", which in turn is nested within "Hydrogenation", this folder will create a subfolder called "Hydrogenation", into which the image files will be stored and entitled by these names connected with underscores (_). In the given example, this system outputs "Hydrogenation_C6.png" and "Hydrogenation_CH2O.png". See [Example](#example) below.
